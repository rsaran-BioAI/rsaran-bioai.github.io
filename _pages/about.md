I am the CEO and Co-Founder of a Stealth mode AI-guided Biotech and an Affiliate Research Scientist at <a href='https://icasssd.org'>International Center for Applied Systems Science for Sustainable Development</a>, Cambridge, ON, Canada. Biochemistry, Biotechnology, and Artificial Intelligence are central to my work. Nucleic Acids bear powerful properties of self-assembly, recognition ability, programmability, and ease of synthesis, chemical modification, etc. Synthetic Functional Nucleic Acids (FNAs) such as Aptamers, DNAzymes, Therapeutic Nucleic Acids, etc. offer transformative potential in various fields such as biosensing, biocatalysts, biomaterials, biomedical diagnostics, bioimaging, drug delivery, biotherapy, environmental monitoring, etc.

I hold a PhD in Nanotechnology/Chemistry from  the University of Waterloo with [Juewen Liu](https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/profile/liujw). I received a M.S. in Biotechnology from Anna University, India.

Research interests:
  - **Functional Nucleic Acids** 
  - **Biotechnology** 
  - **AI in Healthcare**
